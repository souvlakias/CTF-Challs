# NTUAH4CK
- NTUAH4CK is a 3 day event hosted by the National Technical University of Athens, that features worskhops, professional talks and a CTF competition. 
- These are the challenges that I made for NTUAH4CK [2023](https://github.com/CS-IEEE-SB-NTUA/NTUA_H4CK_Writeups/tree/main) and [2024](https://github.com/Thread-in-the-Needle/NTUAH4CK-3.0).
